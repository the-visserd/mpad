Before we start this experiment, we have to make sure that in the protocol of Medoc Main Station (MMS) the following values are as defined as in the psychopy script:


| Psychopy script      | MMS                |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| `mms_baseline`       | Basislinie         |
| `mms_rate_of_rise`   | Suchrate (°C/s)    |
| `stimuli.duration`   | Dauer (s)          |
